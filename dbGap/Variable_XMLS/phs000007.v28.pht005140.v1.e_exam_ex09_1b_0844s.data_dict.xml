Surviving Offspring and Omni Group 1 participants were invited to attend clinic examination 9/4 respectively. Participants who declined a clinic examination were offered a visit in their personal residence or nursing home. The examination included a physician-administered medical history interview (or for examinations that occurred outside the research clinic, a technician-administered interview), technician-administered questionnaires to assess cognitive and physical function, and clinical measurements (anthropometric measurements, ECG and physical performance measures). In addition participants underwent ankle-brachial blood pressure testing and pulmonary function testing. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires that asked about diet, sleep and health.</description><variable id="phv00254010.v1"><name>shareid</name><description>Unique study participant identification number</description><type/></variable><variable id="phv00254011.v1"><name>idtype</name><description>Framingham Heart Study participant cohort identifier</description><type/><comment>IDTYPE and ID taken together form the study participant's ID number.</comment><value code="1">Offspring</value><value code="7">Omni 1</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00254012.v1"><name>j002</name><description>Health Care: 1st Examiner Prefix - page (MD01)</description><type/><value code="0">MD</value><value code="1">Tech</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00254013.v1"><name>j003</name><description>Health Care: Since your last exam or medical history update: Hospitalizations (not just E.R.)</description><type/><value code="0">No</value><value code="1">Yes, hospitalization</value><value code="2">Yes, more than 1 hospitalization</value><value code=".">Unknown</value></variable><variable id="phv00254014.v1"><name>j004</name><description>Health Care: Since your last exam or medical history update: E.R.

Verified outcomes for OS and CT include all cancers, fractures (all fractures for CT; hip fracture only for OS), and cardiovascular outcomes, except DVT and PE. DVT and PE are only verified for HT participants. The outcomes for which central adjudication is required for all OS and CT participants are hip fracture, in situ breast, invasive breast, colon, endometrium, ovary, rectosigmoid junction and rectum cancers. In addition, for CT participants, central adjudication is required for death. MI, Stroke, DVT, and PE are centrally adjudicated for HT participants only. Note: The rel# in the file name is used by the submitter to track embargo releases. Files that have "rel2" or later may either contain additional variables or more recent data as compared to the previous rel#.</description><variable id="phv00193141.v2"><name>SUBJID</name><description>WHI dbGaP Subject ID</description><type>integer</type></variable><variable id="phv00193145.v2"><name>ANGINA</name><description>Angina</description><type>encoded value</type><comment>Angina was adjudicated for CT and OS participants during the core WHI study.

		Death was adjudicated for CT and OS participants through Ext1. In Ext2, death is only adjudicated for the Medical Record Cohort (MRC). Non MRC cause of death is determined by the initial cause of death form (form 120). See the DEATHSRC variable for details about the death adjudication process. This variable censors deaths that occur after the participant's last consented study phase, e.g. if a ppt did not consent to Ext2, but we discovered that she died during Ext2 DEATH would have a value of 0. This is done because the discovery rate of death is inconsistent after participant followup ends.

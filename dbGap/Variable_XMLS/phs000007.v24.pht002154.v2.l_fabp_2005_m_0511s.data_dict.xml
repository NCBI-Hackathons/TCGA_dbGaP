		FABP breaks down into the individual flag groups as follows:1.10 - 137.75 for flag = 16.67 - 214.54 for flag = 24.15 - 100.81 for flag = 318.93 - 85.42 for flag = 4. </comment></variable><variable id="phv00158547.v2"><name>flag</name><description>Data Type Indicator</description><type>encoded</type><comment>When doing analysis, use flag = 1 and 2.

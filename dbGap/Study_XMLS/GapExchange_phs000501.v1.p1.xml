<p>In response to requests from the scientific community, the NIH implemented a change in the procedures for accessing aggregate-level data. Under the modified procedures, interested investigators can request all aggregate datasets designated for general research use with a single application. Additionally, to help expedite the processing of requests for aggregate genomic datasets, the requests will be reviewed by a single, central Data Access Committee. The request process for these datasets is identical to those for individual-level, controlled-access data, such as the expectation that investigators will abide by the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-07-088.html" target="_blank"><i>NIH Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies</i></a> and <a href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/GWAS_Code_of_Conduct.html" target="_blank">dbGaP Genomic User Code of Conduct</a>.</p>]]>

Genome-wide genotyping data from an initial 1,251 neuroblastoma patient and 2,236 disease-free control discover set were filtered based on pre-specified quality control measures where individual SNPs were excluded from further analysis if they showed: 1) deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium with P &lt; 0.0001; 2) individual SNP genotype yield &lt; 98%; or 3) minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 5%.</brk>This resulted in 464,934 SNPs being utilized in the subsequent analyses. In addition, 33 samples had genotype yields &lt; 90% and were removed (23 cases and 10 controls). Finally, since the case samples were accrued nation-wide, while the control set was recruited locally in Philadelphia, we performed principal components analyses to identify outlier samples in order to reduce the effects of population stratification. This approach removed 379 samples (196 cases and 183 controls), leaving 1,032 cases and 2,043 controls for our discovery case series with self-reported ethnicity of Caucasian.Of the 1,032 patients included in the discovery case series, clinical and biological covariate data obtained at diagnosis was available for most. A total of 883 patients (85.6%) had complete outcome data available with a median follow-up interval of 4.02 years for patients without an event.

This analysis is for stage I of a designed two-stage GWAS. The genotyping was performed using HumanHap550 BeadChips (Illumina, Inc.). Following quality control filtering a final dataset of 463,185 SNPs was analyzed in 1,713 PD cases and 3,978 controls from the United States and Germany.
<p>To assess the homogeneity of our cohort, pair-wise Identity by State distances were calculated using HapMap data as a reference. The results of these analyses reveal that our samples share common Caucasian ancestry. Power calculations showed that our sample had 80% power to detect variants conferring an odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 with an allele frequency of 10%. Each SNP was tested for association using a trend model.</p>
The genotype data being made available within the dbGaP Study Accession phs000089.v3.p2, consist of cases and controls from the United States from the stage I analysis that are eligible for inclusion in dbGap.  Samples for this study are available through Coriell under the NINDS Repository Collection.

		<Description> To investigate genetic variants that affect iron concentrations in persons not affected by overt genetic disorders of iron metabolism, a genome-wide association study was conducted in participants of European descent from the InCHIANTI Study (N=1206) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA, N=713).  Genome-wide data from each study was filtered if they deviated from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (P &#60;0.0001), had low call rate (&#60;99%) or low minor allele frequency (MAF &#60; 1%). The resulting 475,322 autosomal SNPs that passed quality control were used for association analysis.</Description>

		<Description>Genome-wide genotyping data was generated on the Illumina HumanHap550 Beadchip for 1,627 neuroblastoma patients and 3,254 genetically matched disease-free controls. All samples passed our pre-specified quality control measures, and 1,529 neuroblastoma cases have complete clinical phenotype data, as provided by the COG.  To correct for potential effects of population structure, genome-wide IBS estimates for all pair-wise comparisons among all case subjects and control subjects were analyzed to identify two matched controls for each case. SNPs were excluded from further analysis if they showed: 1) deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium with P &#60; 0.001; 2) individual SNP genotype yield &#60; 95%; 3) minor allele frequency (MAF) &#60; 5%; or 4) were not present on both version 1 (V1) and version 3 (V3).

This analysis of association between genotype and nine quantitative traits related to metabolic syndrome was conducted in a population sample from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC66).  NFBC66 individuals are from the two northernmost provinces of Finland, were all born in 1966 and were age 31 at the time of assessment, were not ascertained for any particular disorder/disease, consented to the use of their DNA for genetic analysis studies, and were successfully genotyped on the Illumina 370 CNV platform.  Genotyping was done at the Broad Institute using the Illumina 370CNV Genotyping Beadchip.
<p>Please note: Following publication of our paper <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&cmd=DetailsSearch&term=19060910>Nat Genet. 2009 Jan;41(1):35-46</a>, the project was able to have more samples genotyped and we have used this final set of genotype data in the submission to dbGaP; therefore the number of genotyped subjects in dbGaP is higher than that in our previously published analysis.</p>

This analysis of association between genotype and nine quantitative traits related to metabolic syndrome was conducted in a population sample from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC66).  NFBC66 individuals are from the two northernmost provinces of Finland, were all born in 1966 and were age 31 at the time of assessment, were not ascertained for any particular disorder/disease, consented to the use of their DNA for genetic analysis studies, and were successfully genotyped on the Illumina 370 CNV platform.  Genotyping was done at the Broad Institute using the Illumina 370CNV Genotyping Beadchip.
<p>Please note: Following publication of our paper <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&cmd=DetailsSearch&term=19060910>Nat Genet. 2009 Jan;41(1):35-46</a>, the project was able to have more samples genotyped and we have used this final set of genotype data in the submission to dbGaP; therefore the number of genotyped subjects in dbGaP is higher than that in our previously published analysis.</p>

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Family Heart Study (FamHS) is a genetic epidemiological family study conducted in four clinical centers over two visits, approximately 8 years apart.  Genotyping for Phase 1 was conducted at Washington University in St. Louis, MO using the IIlumina HumMap 550 chip.  The results presented here are from FamHS genome wide association analysis for association between genotypes and the phenotypic trait as <b>&#34;Body Mass Index(Weight in kg/ Height in m&#94;2)&#34;</b> at Visit 1.

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Family Heart Study (FamHS) is a genetic epidemiological family study conducted in four clinical centers over two visits, approximately 8 years apart.  Genotyping for Phase 1 was conducted at Washington University in St. Louis, MO using the IIlumina HumMap 550 chip.  The results presented here are from FamHS genome wide association analysis for association between genotypes and the phenotypic trait as <b>&#34;Derived FEV1/FVC Ratio&#34;</b> at Visit 1.  The sample size is 816 and the covariates are Age, Age squared, Age cubed, Sex, Clinical Centers.

		<Description>The number of cigarettes smoked per day was ascertained through questionaires given to individuals participating in multiple disease projects at deCODE genetics. Current smokers were asked how much they currently smoke and previous smokers were asked how much they smoked before quitting. Smokers were given a choice between four categories: 0-9 cigaretes per day, 10-19 cigarettes per day, 20-29 cigarettes per day and 30 or more cigarettes per day.</Description>

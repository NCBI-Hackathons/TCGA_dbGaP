	<Description><![CDATA[
<p>The NHLBI "Grand Opportunity" Exome Sequencing Project (GO-ESP), a signature project of the NHLBI Recovery Act investment, was designed to identify genetic variants in coding regions (exons) of the human genome (the "exome") that are associated with heart, lung and blood diseases. These and related diseases that are of high impact to public health and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups will be studied. These data may help researchers understand the causes of disease, contributing to better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases, as well as determine whether to tailor prevention and treatments to specific populations. This could lead to more effective treatments and reduce the likelihood of side effects. GO-ESP is comprised of five collaborative components: 3 cohort consortia - HeartGO, LungGO, and WHISP - and 2 sequencing centers - BroadGO and SeattleGO.</p> <p>In the Grand Opportunities Exome Sequencing Program Early MI Project (GO ESP - EOMI), we are sequencing cases with extremely early-onset MI drawn from 8 cohorts. These cohorts include five hospital or community-based studies that ascertained individuals based on MI status. These include PennCATH, Cleveland Clinic Genebank, Massachusetts General Hospital Premature Coronary Artery Disease Study (MGH-PCAD), Heart Attack Risk in Puget Sound (HARPS), and Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Myocardial Infarction Patients&#39; Health Status (TRIUMPH). Cases were selected based on MI occurring in men aged &#8804;50 years and women aged &#8804;60 years. In addition, early-MI cases are being drawn from three population-cohort studies including the Framingham Heart Study, the Women&#39;s Health Initiative, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. MI-free controls are being drawn from five population-based cohort studies including the Framingham Heart Study, the Women&#39;s Health Initiative, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Jackson Heart Study. Controls were selected based on two factors: (1) highest predicted risk for MI based on Framingham risk score; and (2) absence of prevalent or incident MI despite a high predicted risk.</p>]]>
